            "description": "The Waterdown Trail to Smokey Hollow is a peaceful and beautiful little spot that connects to plenty of trails, and of course this main route. The trail takes users to the viewing overlook of the falls right at the beginning of the path, and if they keep walking a little the route will bring users to the bottom and they can fairly easily get themselves closer to the waterfall. This is a majestic trail, with plenty of variety and changes of inclines and declines and twists and turns. ",
